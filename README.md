## Showcase: Score keeping and skill analytics (SATraS)
This talk showcases a homemade piece of software built by glueing together a few libraries in python. 
It includes data gathering and parsing (Wisent), algorithms to extract valuable information (trueskill, Pandas) as well as some visualization (Dash).
It's designed to keep track of scores in any multiplayer game and shows the skills and development of players. 
It also has the option to quantify influencing factors.
